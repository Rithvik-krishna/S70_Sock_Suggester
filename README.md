# S70_Sock_Suggester

Project Summary

A rather strange but funny way to suggest socks to users depending on how they are feeling. Indulging in some totally weird principles of humor, creativity-aspect, and indicativeness-all rolled in one application for suggestions about the well-suited socks by the user input or mood analysis. The intention here is just to provide an entertaining and light-hearted recommendation journey associated with demonstrating an understanding of recommendation algorithms and user interface design.

Sock Stories: These are merely toy stories which tie together each pair of socks for users to enjoy even more.
